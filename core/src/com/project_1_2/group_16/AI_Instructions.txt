please put a paramater for an App.java object in the constructor

to shoot the ball, use app.shoot(vX, vY) (where app = an instance of App.java)

golfball position: app.golfball.getPosition()
hole position: App.flagpole.getPosition()

sandpits: Terrain.sandpits
trees: Terrain.trees
height profile: Terrain.getHeight(x, y)

App.allowHit tells you if the ball is still moving or is at a stop
